## Documentation

The data in this KG was taken from the Boardgamegeek dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek), which in turn is based on the https://boardgamegeek.com/ website. Thousands of games! 

This iteration of the ontology is not particularly advanced - it is intended to be a practice data set for people getting their feet wet with ontologies and KGs. In fact, there are some obvious improvements that I encourage you all to make - a good practice task might be creating a Person class, for instance. 

For details on the current ontology, please see [this documentation.](https://susvej.github.io/bg_ontology/ontospy_gendocs/index.html)

For code generating the ontology documentation (which you might not have access to), see [this colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10Trh2cXFGjlTVRwlChWXaZ_9C714C7ih?usp=sharing)
